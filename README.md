# About Calendar
In this project, I'm building a React Calendar with TypeScript. In this initial version, the calendar allows you to select two dates: a "from" date and a "to" date. The "from" date represents the starting point, and the "to" date represents the ending point for a date range selection.

For future versions of this calendar plugin, I have planned two key improvements:

Display of Selected Dates: In upcoming releases, I aim to enhance the user experience by displaying the selected "from" and "to" dates prominently within the calendar interface. This will provide users with a clear visual representation of their chosen date range.

"Return to Today" Button: Additionally, I plan to introduce a "return to today" button, which will allow users to quickly navigate back to the current date, making it more convenient to reset their selection and return to the present.

These improvements will make the React Calendar more user-friendly and efficient, catering to a wider range of user needs and preferences.
